GPU
==============
First make sure you've run the setup.sh script in the directory above this one to initialize the openfast datasets.
This only needs to be done once unless we change compilers.

To run this test, you will need to make sure the spack environment you used to build the exawind stack is active
i.e. (spack env activate my-gpu-build)

Then, do:
sh script_frontier.sh -a=256 -n=16 -rpn=8

This will devote 256 nodes (2048 GPUs) to amr-wind and 16 nodes (128 GPUs) to each nalu instance with 1 turbine. You can vary this parameter to add more or less GPUs.
