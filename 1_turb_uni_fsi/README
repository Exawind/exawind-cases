This test case is for running a single blade resolved nrel5mw turbine in an ABL
To set this case up make sure you have a valid build of the exawind driver with FSI enabled via spack-manager

For example:

quick-create -n exawind-gpu -s exawind+rcom+amr_wind_gpu+nalu_wind_gpu+fsi
spack install

Then run the setup.sh script with the FSI environment activated.

``` shell
setup.sh -n=[name you want for the run, default is the date]
```

This will create a run directory `run_[name]`, populate the files, run the openfast precursor and move all the files you need into the run directory.
If you include the `-s=True` flag then it will also submit a job for you on the platform, and the `-e=[your email]` command will have slurm email you about the job.

The files are processed for each machine based on the values in the `template_files/[machine]_aprepro.txt` file.
You can tweak things there, but it would be best to tweak them in the run directory and open a PR if a change needs to be made to these templates.
